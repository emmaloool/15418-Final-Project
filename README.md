### Summary

We implemented one of the stages of the WebP image encoding pipeline on NVIDIA GPUs, to take advantage of the parallelism offered by CUDA. To do so, we investigated the algorithms used by the reference implementation of WebP encoding and rewrote several versions of portions of the encoding pipeline to best take advantage of CUDA. We then compared the modified pipelineâ€™s performance on both GHC Cluster machines and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Cluster Bridges machines, versus the sequential C implementation.
